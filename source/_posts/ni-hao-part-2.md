As promised I am documenting how I am hacking together learning chinese you can read why in [Ni Hao! Part 1](/2015/01/18/ni-hao-part-1/).

I couldn't find a class or tutor that fit my needs because most of them are shit and are bloated with crap. I don't need to be learning the vocabulary word for construction worker and  chocolate cake, I don't care about stroke order of words. What I want is to recognize the Chinese character and be able to pronounce it and I want to learn this as fast as possible on my own schedule. Here is my method:


#### Rick Chen's super lazy learn Chinese as fast as possible without any bullshit or actual learning, method of learning Chinese.

This method only works if you have some intermediate background in Chinese.

1. Go to a Chinese relatives' Facebook page! We want to use posts made from his / her friends, because it will have slang and sentence structure that can help express personality and it will be more natural than learning vocab out of a traditional book.

2. Copy a message that we don't understand and paste into Google translate. Hit the audio button to get a sense of what the sentence sounds like. Google translate and facebook's built in translate does a shit job at translating the meaning of sentences. It is not close enough most of the time.

4. After you hear the basic sentence structure, go back and start with one character and paste only that into Google translate. Hit the audio button to hear the word and see the definition. Google translate does this very well.

6. Once you are comfortable, paste the characters as logical blocks together and repeat the process.

7. Move in chunks of one or two words through the sentence. Google translate does poorly with long sentences, say 7 - 10 words long, but it's fucking accurate when it's just one or two words.

Voila! One hour of this a day and I should be pretty damn fluent. This only works because I have some context and am able to fill in the gaps that Google translate misses, sorry! Hopefully this will inspire or help someone with the same struggles.
