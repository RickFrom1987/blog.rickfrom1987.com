I got some cool new people I am working with!

#### Moment Lens

Really excited to help out Moment Lens. They make an awesome lens that makes your mobile phone into a badass camera. They also got a couple of really interesting projects down the line that I am pretty excited about!

Hopefully I can help improve their current stuff and help a bit with their process. Exciting times. 

#### General Assembly

I'm gunna be like a Frontend / UI Assassin, helping students simplify and clean up the look and feel of their projects.

Still not sure about this program, going to see if it's legit or not. I think that the education system in the U.S is rubbish and I think that small focused classes that teach a very specific skillset is going to be the future for a large portion of the world, especially tech.

Hopefully I will be able to add value somewhere, as well as learn from these places! Nervous and excited about both.
