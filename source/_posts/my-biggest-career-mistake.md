I am very hesitant to make this post for many reasons, but I made this costly mistake because I didn't know any better, so I am going to put it up so hopefully some young Rick Chen somewhere reads this and learns from it.

###### Warning: Preachy self satisfaction ahead, read on at your own risk.

The biggest mistake I have ever made was taking a job for VMware. If you don't know VMware... It's this massive tech company based in Palo Alto. They make some complicated shit. I worked there for almost two years. Wow. Before you read any further, let me say this:

**Disclaimer: my mistake was my own fault and it has nothing to do with VMware or anyone there.**

1. **My team was awesome.**
The team that I worked with was awesome. I legit enjoyed being around everyone I worked with, by the end I'm not sure they felt the same way : )

2. **The company was awesome too.**
VMware was totally flexible in my schedule and compensation. I also got to play soccer on the company field whenever I wanted, almost everyday. On paper it was a sweet deal.


#### So why was it my biggest mistake?

1. **Working for someone else and not focusing on building my brand and raising value in myself (this is where I felt the most self value and worth).** 
For the sake of being transparent my total salary + stocks etc. was roughly 135K per year. To a 24 year old, first generation asian american from an immigrant family, this type of money was earth shattering. There was no way in hell I could turn that down. This is exactly how those in power and the wealthy want you to think. Work hard for us and you will get paid a high salary to buy things. It's complete insanity. Think about it... even if your salary was magically 250K a year well within the top 5% you probably would still try to work at minimum 5 years. That's 5 years doing something you aren't 100% vested in. Also please don't lie to yourself, like I did. Most jobs that pay high salaries aren't things that people grow up wanting to do. I wish someone grabbed me by the neck and gave me a wake up call.

2. **Opportunity cost.**
When I accepted the job, I knew I would be a little unhappy, but the opportunity cost is still burning me up. I gave up so much in those two years that I didn't even think about. I gave up two years of learning how to actually program; I gave up two years of building products I love; I gave up two years of learning to play the piano. These are priceless. I value the things I lost @ about 1 million dollars. Won't get the time back. I am still feeling the pain almost 3 years later. Ouch.

3. **Learned almost nothing.**
This was mainly me being lazy to be honest, but I digress. A year after VMware I took a much lower paying job, but it was on a product which I loved and at a place where I felt at home. It also required me to work much longer hours. Pretty crappy deal fiscally right? No. I took a big hit to the check book, but the value and experience it gave me was worth millions. This job rejuvenated me and made me love what I was doing again, because I was learning and applying my knowledge into creating something cool. I am now more confident and better at what I do. Because of this I can demand more from employers and demand more time for myself doing things I want to do!

**tldr;** Work for the paycheck (keeps it real) if you have to, but please, please I urge you to build your brand and create real value in yourself. Work only on things that make you happy and ignore everything else.
