Over my short software development career, 5 years to date, I have gone through three instances of layoffs or team members getting cut. They are both not very fun at all. I have been directly effected by only one. For those who haven't gone through one before it is a very strange and impersonal experience. It always seems very abrupt and evil for some reason. Even though I know business is business it still seems like the company is saying, 

"Hey, Thanks for your last few years of service... we don't need you anymore, you suck. Don't let the door hit you on the way out." 

As someone who strives to create a happy place to work for myself and fellow team members it is quite disheartening. It is tough to wake up every morning motivated when people are getting the axe left and right. I've learned a few key things to help you the lowly employee guy/girl get the most out of being part of a "downsized" team. 

#### 3 Things to know before starting your next job...

1. Understand that you are probably expendable. Layoffs and firings happen at large stable companies and small startups. Sometime unexpectedly.

2. Be a swiss army knife. Don't be afraid to spend some time during your work hours to learn universal skills that transfer well to other industries or companies. If your boss doesn't like you learning more skills than it is not a place you will want to be in a few years anyways.

3. Don't take layoffs personally. Most company execs and CEO's are kind of assholes. They are there to make money and look out for their friends and themselves. Note I said, 'most', of course there are always exceptions.

I understand this may not apply to those who are super intelligent, hardworking and lucky enough to be on amazing teams all the time, but to those fighters in the trenches this article is for you.
