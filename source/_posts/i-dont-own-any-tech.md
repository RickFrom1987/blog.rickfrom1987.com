I recently shattered my new iPhone and started using an old iPhone 4. I was trying to use some apps likes Uber and Google Maps and they both were quite buggy and crashed quite a bit. It makes sense as devices move on, apps and app developers need to as well and can't support every device in perpituity. I just stared at my iPhone 4 for a while and realized that basically I had just rented this device from Apple for about a year or so because none of my favorite apps were reliable enough for daily use. Sure I can call or text friends / family, but who does that anymore? Then my brain went into future mode and thought: damn I am going to be upgrading devices and apps for the rest of my life and I will never truly own a phone anymore, like my first trusty Nokia. There are both pros and cons, because new devices come out, apps can use newer and better hardware for awesome features. 

From a capitalist point of view, it's actually really great for companies and the bottom line to move to this model. Apparently John Deere has been doing this with their tractors, I'm not really up to date on farming tech, but it was very interesting to read up on. It makes sense that in the future most companies will more than likely move in this direction. Is this something I like?
