I have been working and hanging out with the wonderful people at Moment Lens for about 6 months now and it has been an awesome ride so far! In my short time here I have already seen them raise around 700K on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/584288471/moment-case-worlds-best-iphone-case-for-mobile-pho/description) for the [Moment Case](http://momentlens.co/case/). Yay. I call my role here, "Startup Technology Guy" because I have been working on a plethora of random technology related things to help the business run a bit smoother. Here are some of my random thoughts so far:

1. Basic Infrastructure. Their online shop and website was standing up and operating fairly well, but they wanted features, design changes and stability with little infrastructure to support it. I started by moving them onto version control and getting everything into Github asap, before editing a single line of code. I also setup some basic tests and pingdom monitoring so we could make small steps forward. Lessons here is to think about removing code before adding more! 

2. Wordpress Plugin Hell. They didn't have a full time dev on the site prior to my arrival so they were able to get what they needed by adding a ton of Wordpress and Woocommerce plugins. The problem here is that they are constantly needing updates and can cause issues when doing theme or feature development. Also it is hell on page load time (this affected the site on mobile heavily). Before writing any more code I sat down with the team and went through every plugin to decide whether we actually needed them or not and defensively patched and removed plugins that we didn't need to help make our codebase smaller and less of a headache.

3. Streamlining Monotonous Tasks. My first major contribution was to help streamline their ordering process within WooCommerce. They had a manual process that took our customer support gal hours to complete. I hacked together a Woocommerce plugin that took away this task. The code is not ideal as I have zero experience writing Woocommerce plugins, but it worked and we moved forward.

4. Data and Analytics. Turns out it is really important to understand your users and their buying behaviors. The learning in this area has been immense for me. I have always just setup Google analytics and that was the end of that. I am now using Google analytics a bit more carefully now. Working here has taught me that thinking carefully about where and when to hook into google analytics actions and events can make a world of difference in understanding a user base!

5. Diverse backgrounds. Prior to working with Moment I have only been working with people who care about software and how software is going to eat the world. It is refreshing and quite fun to work with ...

  - Founders that care more about the customers and team than themselves.
  - Design Team that is very passionate about creating.
  - Photographers that capture beautiful moments.
  - Ridiculously talented hardware people.


So far the journey has been amazing. I have learned so much more about how software can be applied within a startup to help in many different ways!
