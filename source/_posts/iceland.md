I was fortunate enough to travel to Iceland in Feb. of 2014. It was a trip of lifetime. Everything just seemed so epic and pristine. Everyone was absolutely friendly and helpful. I don't have a bad word to say about Iceland. If I ever get a chance would love to return. Here are some photos that stood out to me.

#### Words can't describe the landscape.
