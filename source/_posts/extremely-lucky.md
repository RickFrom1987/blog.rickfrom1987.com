Sometimes I feel myself start to fall into a pattern of simply existing and not living in the moment. I feel like I should be exploring space or something not just a professional chiller. I try not to, but life just gets kind of monotonous and boring sometimes. I am just leaving this note here to remind myself that I have been very lucky and I should be fucking thankful for the people and the ability to work and contribute to the community around me.
