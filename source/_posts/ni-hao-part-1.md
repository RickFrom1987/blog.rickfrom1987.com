I wanted to write about something I rarely ever talk about. I don't really discuss this issue with friends or family. It has been bothering me lately, so I thought I would put it out there. I recently got back from a trip to Taipei or as I like to call it the Motherland. Every time I go back it is always bittersweet. It reminds me a lot of my mother, the care free days and all the good times when I was a kid. I try not to dwell in the past, but the times were very good.

What bothers me comes from the fact that I can't really connect with many of my family members because like many first generation Asian Americans I have difficulty reading, writing and expressing my thoughts in Chinese. I can get by, but I can't articulate complex thoughts and fuel interesting discussions. It's incredibly frustrating and it's all my fault. My Chinese is about the level of a 6th or 7th grader. Boo.

All the Chinese tutors and programs I found were mostly bloated with crap that I don't really care about, like courses, schedules, homework and more useless crap. Ain't nobody got time for that. I came up with quick and hacky way for me to learn what I needed. I am documenting it and will post about it in [Ni Hao! Part 2](/2015/01/19/ni-hao-part-2/)

My new year resolution is to go back to Taipei twice a year and learn Chinese better.
