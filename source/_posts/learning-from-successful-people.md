I am currently trying to figure out what it would take for me to consider my life a "success". At the end of my life my biggest fear is just to be content with what I have done and the relationships I have built. I am sorry to say that it feels like I am heading down this route. So, what can I do to turn this around?

I have no idea how to go about solving my problem. So I began by thinking of all the many smart, talented and super successful people I have met or worked with in the past and what they had in common. 

As I started to group together the people I admire. I noticed two distinct buckets forming...more about these people during story time.

1. The Awesomeness Bucket - These people seem so happy with exactly what they are doing, they have many healthy relationships and whenever I am around them I feel a sense of confidence and awesomeness that I can't explain. These are some cool ass mofos. They are never worried about work or money.

2. The Career / Work Bucket - These people are beasts in every sense of the word. They are so good at what they do. They strive for perfection and I often look to these people for answers to all my problems. They usually have sound advice and are well respected.

#### Story Time

1. Let's call her Jill. Jill is in the awesome bucket. She always has something fun for everyone to do. She is constantly being called, texted and doing cool stuff. She always included me when I felt left out and always made me feel more awesome! She is currently very awesome, but her career hasn't really formed and she is doing a job that won't leave a mark on the world.

2. Let's call him Mike. Mike is in the career / work bucket. Everytime I talked with Mike, he was always stoic, never waivering. Very short with his answers. Not mean or nice. When we did activites that he wasn't very good at he always demanded more of himself and from others. His demands were usually pushing others way beyond their own skill and comfort level. Mike is currently one of Uber's top execs.

3. Let's call him Bill. Bill is in the career / work bucket never in the awesomeness bucket. Bill was annoying. He bugged the shit out of me. I would never hang out with this dude outside of work. However, Bill was nice. Never said a mean word to anyone or anything. Just kind of corny. He was always networking and was so passionate about what he was doing, he seemed disinguenien. Bill recently started his own company and raised over 10 million dollars to run it. I don't care about the money or company the key here is ... he seems happy.


After writing this post, I know I will only consider my life a success if I am top in both buckets. Over my entire life I have met very few people that fall into both categories. This scares me.

Steps I am going to take to make progress:

1. Ignore negative people and cut out people that don't fall into either bucket or push me to be the best I can in both buckets. This is a bit difficult to do when friends or family are involved. Good Luck.

2. Understand that success in both buckets is rare. Be patient and make small strides everyday.

I am very proud with what I have done so far in my life. I am working everyday to improve, learn and enjoy life a bit more. I want to be the guy in someone else's happiness bucket and career/work bucket. Maybe that is too much to ask of myself, or maybe I am just being a lazy prick.
